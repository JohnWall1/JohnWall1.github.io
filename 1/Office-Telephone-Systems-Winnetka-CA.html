<p>As all of us know, VoIP is one of the hottest topics in the telecom industry that has actually changed the method people think of interactions. A PBX system routes incoming calls to the proper extension in an office. Voice over IP converts your voice into a digital signal, compresses it, and sends it over the internet. Medium-sized and small organisations like yours require the exact same innovative and reliable interaction solutions as large companies do, but without the high expenses or aggravating complexity.

<p>2. The digital signals are translated into Internet Protocol (IP) packets. Internet phone services offer organisations with the mobility, flexibility, and advanced call functions that weren't possible with on-premises phone systems.

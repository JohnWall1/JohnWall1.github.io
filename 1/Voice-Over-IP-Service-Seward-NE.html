Traditional PBX solutions have been utilized for medium and big companies for decades, and good reason-- the sheer reliability of a standard analog connection combined with the functionality of a PBX is hard to beat. While the most advanced systems presently readily available are VoIP or Voice over IP, which run voice and information on a joint line, there are still lots of feasible choices in other areas.</p>
<p>But cloud phone systems get rid of the PBX metaphor and instead choose a various concept: Unified Communications (UC). Some features, such as voicemail to text, are special to cloud-based phone systems. A micro-sized office could get by quickly with the bare-bones Office Pro setup, however the sophisticated functions of Office Pro Plus and Office Enterprise are tempting for a couple of dollars more: the Nextiva mobile voice and video app and the Group Existence status indicator (both included in Office Pro Plus) are useful upgrades, as are call recording and the number-meshing Nextiva Anywhere app (Office Business).</p>
